# Apple Silicon M4 Optimized Startup Script for Bytebot C/ua Framework
# 
# This startup script implements M4-specific optimizations to:
# - Minimize virtualization overhead (target: 5-10% CPU overhead)
# - Optimize memory usage for unified memory architecture (target: 4-6GB)
# - Enable high-performance shared memory IPC
# - Prioritize Apple Silicon performance cores
# - Implement fast boot optimizations (target: <30s startup)
#
# Performance Targets (based on research report):
# - Reduce CPU overhead from 25% to 5-10%
# - Optimize memory from 8GB to 4-6GB efficient allocation  
# - Container startup time from 120s to <30s
# - OCR processing latency improvement by 40-50%

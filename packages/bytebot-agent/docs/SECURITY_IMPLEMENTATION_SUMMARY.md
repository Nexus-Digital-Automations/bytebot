### 3. Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data storage
- **SSL/TLS**: Mandatory HTTPS in production with proper certificate management
- **Database Security**: Connection pooling with SSL requirements
- **Secret Management**: Support for external secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets)

### 4. Production Security Controls
- **Environment Separation**: Distinct security profiles for dev/staging/production
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure protection and recovery
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks and metrics
- **Audit Logging**: Structured JSON logging for security events and compliance
